<h2 align="left">Philosophy</h2>

<p align="left">A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Background information</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1935 it was my good fortune to be born in the state of Iowa, U.S.A.&nbsp; My parents were low to middle class people of German, Irish, and English origin.&nbsp; I was also fortunate to be able to attend public schools in Iowa from Kindergarten to Ph.D.&nbsp;&nbsp; I retired as Professor Emeritus from Iowa State University in 1997.</p>

<p align="left">B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Motivation to write software</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many students and researchers throughout the world can not afford to buy statistics books and programs for their personal use.&nbsp; I personally believe free education should be available to all people, not just those with the ability to buy their education.&nbsp; The internet now provides a means for distributing a wide variety of instructional material (books, programs, dictionaries, etc.)&nbsp; If computers or terminals can be made available to them, people can now gain instruction in just about any subject.&nbsp; For example, the Kahn Academy computer site provides coursework in a large array of topics.&nbsp; Search &quot;engines&quot; can find many of these educational sites.&nbsp; I began the development of statistics software soon after I built an &quot;Altair&quot; computer from a kit back in 1970 using the BASIC language.&nbsp; Commodor computers were the next platform and finally the PC&#39;s.&nbsp; My original motivation was to develop statistics programs that could be used by my students in educational statistics.&nbsp; Following my retirement I continued the work as a hobby.&nbsp; Since then the package has grown to include procedures useful to a wide variety of disciplines.&nbsp; As a professor, I also taught computer programming and electronics in addition to statistics.&nbsp; Using multiple languages (BASIC, COBOL, COMAL, LOGO, Pascal, C and C++) has been fun and helpful in teaching programming.&nbsp; In many respects I like Pascal for development but C++ is more widely used in the commercial world.&nbsp; Compilors that have an &quot;Integrated Development Environment (IDE) make the development of programs with graphical interfaces far easier than others.&nbsp; I have used the Borland Delphi (Pascal) and Borland C++ packages for the past 15 years.&nbsp; Because of the development of Window types of systems (Microsoft Windows, Apple OSx, Linux, etc.) cross-platform development has been a challenge.&nbsp; The Lazarus project now provides the ability to write a program (in Pascal) that can be compiled for multiple operating systems.&nbsp; While there are still some minor compatability issues with this tool, the fact that it is free makes it inviting.&nbsp; My LazStats program was written in the Lazarus IDE to make a package similar to OpenStat available for Linux (and other) platforms.&nbsp; Again, use of a free compiler as advanced as Lazarus makes the world of programming available to anyone with internet access.&nbsp; The Java language is another free package which can be used to develop programs.&nbsp; Free education!&nbsp; That is the goal.</p>

<p align="left">C&nbsp;&nbsp; Education</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be clear from the previous sections that I believe education is the most important tool that we have for improving the world.&nbsp; Further, we should endeavor to make it free and continuous.&nbsp; Television and the computer have great potential for delivery of free instruction.&nbsp; If you have beeen a teacher, you know there are wide differences among children and adults with regard to the readiness and ability to learn.&nbsp; To place children into chronological age groups and give them identical instruction is foolish and ignores reality.&nbsp; While peer interaction and learning of social skills is important, individualized instruction can still exist within a group setting.&nbsp; Using the current and forthcoming technological tools, instruction can be tailored to the individual&#39;s needs.&nbsp; There are 7 year old children ready to learn some skills and knowledge that some college age individuals are not ready to learn.&nbsp; If we examine the cost of buildings, staff, supplies, etc. we can see why education, particularly at the college level has become impossible for a growing segment of the population.&nbsp; Certainly we can come up with alternatives that will make the achievement of college degrees available to students with access to a computer.&nbsp; Certification of self-achieved learning goals may pose a challenge to assure honesty and common standards for various &quot;majors&quot; or disciplines.&nbsp; Whether this involves software or even local evaluators to perform, I believe it can be done.</p>
