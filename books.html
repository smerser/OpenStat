The following book is a novella (70 pages) about a young child who&#39;s DNA is accidentally spliced with a fragment from an eagle which had infected his mother.&nbsp; 
Slowly he was transformed into an eagle/boy and enjoyed (and suffered) the lot of an eagle.&nbsp;
His adventures encompassed run-ins with the military and government officials as well as becoming a protector of harassed individuals.&nbsp;
Eventually a friend was able to start a procedure to return him to a normal human form.&nbsp;
This book is designed for junior high and above persons who, like myself, are fascinated by large birds.<p>
