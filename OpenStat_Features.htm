<h2 align="left">The Data Grid</h2>

<p align="left" pbzloc="20"><img alt="" src="MainForm.bmp" style="border-top: 20px solid; height: 500px; border-right: 20px solid; width: 500px; border-bottom: 20px solid; margin: 20px; border-left: 20px solid" /></p>

<p pbzloc="12">The above shows the data grid when the program has begun.&nbsp; Across the top are the main menues which,&nbsp; when clicked, drop down a list of sub-menues.&nbsp; Below that are some boxes which report the current grid row, column, number of cases, number of variables, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) for a character entered in a grid cell, and a status indicator.&nbsp; There is also a box for editing the contents of a previously entered cell value.&nbsp; Below the &quot;grid&quot; where data are entered is a button that when pressed adds another variable column (with a default type of floating point values.)&nbsp; There is also a box which indicates the current name of the file.&nbsp; This changes after the file has been saved.</p>

<h2>The Files Menu</h2>

<p>A variety of options exist for saving and opening data files.&nbsp; The preferred method is to use the file extension .TEX which saves not only the data from the grid but also the definition of the variables in the grid.&nbsp; Tab files are useful for importing data from other programs (for example Excel files) or for exporting a file to another program.</p>

<h2>The Variables Menu</h2>

<p>The typical user, in creating a new data file, will select the &quot;Define&quot; option.&nbsp; This option lets the user specify the name of a variable (grid column), the type of data in the vaiable (floating point, integer, string, etc.), the number of decimal fractions, and a value representing a missing value.&nbsp; One can also sort the data in the grid in an ascending or descending order of one of the variables.&nbsp; Occassionally one will need to transform the values of a variable (for example into normally distributed values) or perform a mathematical transformation such a the log of the values.&nbsp; The user can also combine values of several variables to create a new variable or enter an equation to combine and transform multiple variables.&nbsp; If a file contains one variable of values and another variable containing the frequency count of values in the previous variable, one can construct a new file that contains each of the values in one column.&nbsp; Finally, a large file may be split into several files for different analyses or several files may be merged.</p>

<h2>The Edit Menu</h2>

<p>A typical user will often need to insert a new row or column in the data grid, delete a row or column of the grid, copy and paste row or column data, etc.&nbsp; The Edit menu provides a variety of tools for modifying data in the grid.&nbsp; Excel users, for example, may copy a block of data from an Excel file and paste that block of data into the OpenStat grid.&nbsp; Occassionally a user will need to recode values in one of his or her variables.&nbsp; The recode option provides this capability.&nbsp; In some statistics programs, data which represents group membership may consist of strings such as &quot;Male&quot; or &quot;Female&quot;.&nbsp; OpenStat requires group codes to be integer values.&nbsp; An option exists for creating integer codes from a variable containing string codes.&nbsp; If you are a user from a country that uses the comma (,) to separate decimal fractions rather than the period (.), you are going to be using the European standard for coding numbers.&nbsp; If you load a file using the USA standard (period separator) you may need to switch the coding to the European standard (comma separator.)</p>

<h2>The Analyses Menu</h2>

<p>Under the Analyses main menu are listed a number of major sub-menues.&nbsp;Many of the descriptive and analyses procedures produce graphical output.&nbsp; As an example, the following is a plot of X versus Y from the Descriptives Menu:</p>

<p pbzloc="16"><img alt="" src="AnalysesMenu.JPG" style="border-top: 20px solid; height: 247px; border-right: 20px solid; width: 205px; border-bottom: 20px solid; margin: 10px; border-left: 20px solid" /></p>

<p>Clearly, there are too many procedures to describe here.&nbsp; OpenStat contains a large variety of parametric, nonparametric, multivariate, measurement, statistical process control, financial and other procedures.&nbsp; One can also simulate a variety of data for tests, theoretical distributions, multivariate data, etc.</p>
